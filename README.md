# VTMsite

Made from scratch with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome.
Goal is to create a site for Vampire: The Masquerade where people can use an interactive character creator.
Using AngularJS to make it nice and responsive.
Doing this as a learning experience, it won't look too nice yet.

# Installation & Setup

If you'd like to create your own version of this project, feel free to do so.
Use the VTMSite Setup guide provided as a PDF in the project.
The link is here if you're interested: https://github.com/DrSharky/VTMsite/blob/master/VTMSite%20Setup.pdf
This is not a guide for contributing, as it specifically gives you steps to not create a fork.
The steps on how to copy & make your own was requested a few times, so here it is.
I'll make a different (and probably simpler) set of guidelines for contributing soon.
